=========================================================================================
Put the file in your /plugins folder and modify your theme to use it. Please see the file comments itself for more usage information.

Limitation: 
-----------
You can only choose the album thumb of top level albums currently.

Future plans:

This plugin will be incorporated into the TinyMCE plugin tinyZenpage officially and allow the selection of any image eventually.
